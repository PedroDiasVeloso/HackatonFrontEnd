                <div>1. The Reminder Text Message


                    Send a text to your subscribers reminding them of an upcoming appointment, session, or meeting.
                    Why it works: The added value here is in the thoughtfulness and personalization that comes with the
                    reminder. You’re clearing up their headspace by giving them a reminder of their task and, in turn,
                    reducing the number of pesky no-shows on your end.
